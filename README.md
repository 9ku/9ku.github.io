Revive the values of the Enlightenment with `marat`.

Marat is heavily inspired by [L'Ami du peuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ami_du_peuple), a newspaper written by [Jean-Paul Marat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat) during the French Revolution, in which he was vocal advocate for the rights of man and liberty.
